# Python Training Day 4

This README file provide a brief summary of what I have learned in this module.


## Methods: 

### Class Methods: 
- **Related to the class not the object.**
- **Defined using @classmethod.**
- **Have access to the state of the class and can modify it.**
- **Takes a class parameter that points to the clss itself.**
- **Takes cls as the first implied argument.**

### Static Methods:
- **Related to the class not the object.**
- **Defined using @statismethod.** 
- **Can't modify the state of the class or the instance.** 
- **Used when the the method is not accessing the object or the class.**


## Attributes: 

### Class Attributes: 
- **Set at the class-level**
- **Shared among all instances of the class**.

### Instance Attributes:
- **Set at init level.**
- **Specific to each instance.** 


## Encapsulation:
**To restrict the access to certain parts of an object.**
- **Private Attributes:** can be defined by prefixing the attributs/method with double underscores __
- **Protected Attributes:** can be defined by prefixing the attributs/method with single underscore _

## Properties: 
- **Can be defined using @property.**
- **Allows us to define methods that can be called as attributes.**

## Abstraction:
- **Abstract classes are classes that can't be instantiated.**
- **Abstract methods are methods declared in an abstract class but have no implemntation on the abstract class**.
- **The subclass of the abstract class must provide the implementation for the abstract methods.**

## Method Chaining: 
- **Allows you to call multiple methods on an object consecutively in a single line of code.**

## Multiple Inheritance:
- **A class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one superclass.**
